# Mouse Squad Python Repository For Module 3

Congratulations! You've found the Mouse Squad python respository. If you're working on Module 3, you'll find the relevant portions of the assignment in this folder.

This includes the MouseSquadModule3 file, which exposes a class that has three methods:

* printHelloWorld(), which prints a simple "Hello World" statement.
* printSum(value1, value2), which prints the addition of the two supplied numbers.
* printProduct(value1, value2), which prints the product of the two values.

## Steps to Leverage Github Code

To leverage this, you'll need to copy the python file to your local machine. 
1. Download the "MouseSquadModule2.py" file to your local machine.
2. Upload the file to your c9.com account.
3. Import the file into your console or python file using the import command ("import MouseSquadModule2")

## Sample Consumption Code

import MouseSquadModule3

mouseModule = MouseSquadModule3.MouseModule3()

mouseModule.printHelloWorld()


### Additional Thoughts

What other methods are exposed by this class? How do you call them? Write additional python calls to try calling the other method.

Find the bug! There's a bug in the included MouseSquadModule3.py. Based on your results of your python code, can you spot the error in the code? How would you fix the code?

Try making the adjustments to the MouseSquadModule3.py file to see if you can fix the bug that the file exposes.'
